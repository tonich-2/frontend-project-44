# Brain Games

The "Brain Games" project is a compilation of text-based games for Unix-like operating systems. There are three rounds in each game and in every round there is a question for you. To have a victory you have to answer correctly all three questions in a row.

### Content.
- Actually **brain-games** is a program which asks your name and than greets you. By your name.
- **brain-even.** In each round here you have to answer, is the number even or odd. You must answer only "yes" or "no" (without quotes, in lowercase).
- **brain-calc.** In each round here you have to solve a mathematical expression.
- **brain-gcd.** In each round here you have to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **brain-progression.** In each round here you have to find the missing element of the arithmetic progression.
- **brain-prime.** In each round here you have to answer, is the number prime or composite.


### Minimum system requirements.
Unix-like OS with installed Git is required. If you do not want to install the game package you also need already installed Node.js interpreter.


### Installation and launch.
1. Clone the repository with the games to your computer. For this purpose, run the command:\
`git clone git@github.com:tonich-2/frontend-project-44.git`
2. Go to the directory of the game package - frontend-project-44 - and run the global installation command there:
```bash
cd frontend-project-44
npm link
```
3. After that you can launch every game you like. For this purpose type its name in your console and press enter.

#### If you do not want to install the game package but Node.js is installed.
1. Clone the repository with the games to your computer. For this purpose, run the command:\
`git clone git@github.com:tonich-2/frontend-project-44.git`
